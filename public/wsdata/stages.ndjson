{"title":"Neo Bowser City","description":"Neo Bowser City from Mario Kart 7/8 (Mainly based from the 7 version) Remastered with better art, fancy lighting, and more dynamic clown cars!NOTES:Neo Bowser City was one of the first good stages on the workshop, and one of my first projects. As such it carries a special place in my heart, which is kinda unfortunate considering the old one sucks lmao- I mean it's *alright* but I've learned so much since then, and the jump in quality is apparent even from it to Bonneton. But I've remastered it now, taking everything I've learned to hopefully put it back in it's place as one of the best stages on the workshop!I've added the promised clown car interactions now scripting is out, and I've also used articles to get more layers. Pretty much all the foreground lights are articles, since the real FG1 and FG2 are used for the rain. Speaking of said rain, it's a little more transparent than the old version. A common complaint I got is that it was distracting, so that's been adressed. I also tweaked the top and bottom blast zones- Anyway I hope you enjoy the changes!Legacy version for people who like stinky graphics: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1913020392","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1858309106343913675/875CBB005188850FE390EA9465925DB51681D2D4/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":7258,"currentSubscribers":31704,"currentFavorites":1046},"id":"1913030599"}

{"title":"Kermit's Political Affiliation - Muppet Wiki","description":"On occasion, Kermit the Frog has become involved in politics. While not siding with any one political party, Kermit has often come out in support of the environment, protecting wetlands, and other \"green\" initiatives. He has also spoken out in opposition of marriage between frogs and pigs.Kermit has identified himself as an \"Amphibitarian\" during appearances on political shows such as Hannity & Colmes, The Live Desk, The Colbert Report, and in his 2006 memoir Before You Leap. However, he has also said he was a \"Flippertarian\" on a few occasions as well.As an actor, Kermit has portrayed political leaders - including a mayor, various kings, and US president Thomas Jefferson. As a reporter, Kermit has interviewed several political figures - including future president George Washington and his father, a group of Boston Tea Partyers, presidential advisor David Gergen, and many monarchs and nobles.Kermit has said on numerous occasions that he is not interested in running for public office.Political stances and statementsEditIn the Muppet Babies episode \"Kermit Goes to Washington,\" a young Kermit the Frog ran for president of the nursery.In The Muppets Take Manhattan, New York City mayor Ed Koch said of Kermit, \"if he can also balance the budget, I'll hire him.\" Additionally, Kermit appeared with Koch at an event.In January 1993, Kermit took part in Bill Clinton's first Presidential Inauguration festivities, appearing at the Inaugural Celebration for Children.Kermit helped lobby for the Shambala Wild Animal Protection Act of 2000, a proposed amendment to the United States Animal Welfare Act. Kermit appeared on Capitol Hill in March 2000 as the bill was introduced to the US Congress by Representative Tom Lantos of California's 12th congressional district. Speaking with the press, Kermit said that as a \"representative of the animal kingdom,\" it was important to \"pass this bill to prevent the continuing abuse and cruelty toward exotic animals in this country.\"[1]Wayne Brady asked Kermit about his politics on his show in 2002, in relation to California's governor race. Kermit says most people assume he's a member of the Green Party, but he's actually a Flippertarian.In his 2006 memoir Before You Leap, Kermit wrote:“I've shared my views on serious news programs. Miss Piggy and I were on Nightline to explain the reasons for a major economic downturn. (Some cite our appearance on Nightline as the cause of the crisis.) I even made appearances on political debate shows like Hannity & Colmbes [sic]. I thought I had learned everything about left and right from Sesame Street, but those two guys really taught me a thing or two. (Rather than take sides, I publicly declared my political position as an Amphibitarian. We're opposed to marriages between frogs and pigs.)”Kermit's political stance as an Amphibitarian would be discussed again while promoting Before You Leap on Fox News Channel's The Live Desk.In March 2008, Kermit appeared in Washington, D.C. sponsored by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. He spoke alongside conservationists to help promote awareness of endangered amphibians across the globe.[2] TheHill.com interviewed Kermit, asking about his future political career.“Would I consider running for office? I'd probably hop for office before I'd run. Ha ha! I don't know... Perhaps. I could, y'know, what am I good at? Should I start small, like a mayor, move up the chain? Sure, sure. Why not? Change you can believe in.\"[3]”In a 2008 appearance on 97.1 Free FM's Frosty, Heidi and Frank Show, Kermit and Fozzie talked about the 2008 presidential campaign. Kermit stated that \"[Obama] is more like a frog. You see... if I had ears, don't you think I'd look a little like him?\" Fozzie remarked that he served as the opening act for Obama on the campaign trail.[4]Pictures of Kermit with Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Mikhail Gorbachev hang in Kermit's office in The Muppets. President Carter's name appears in Kermit's Rolodex. Kermit, looking for a celebrity host, attempts to call President Carter, only to learn that he has since moved.In a 2011 CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer, Kermit was asked if he would be reporting on the 2012 presidental campaigns. Kermit said:“I'm going to try. I'm afraid, as a frog, we cannot vote... I am an Amphibian-American. I am proud of it. I am taking a certain issue to discuss with the president, if I can. That's inter-species dating. Which evidently Miss Piggy is for. I'm not so sure about... I wanted to tell all of the animals out there in the world and any people who might date pigs that it will get sorted out, folks.[5]”In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, Kermit said:“I don't get too involved in politics, but I am an amphibitarian. I'm in favour of wetlands, green jobs (that's jobs for anyone who is green) and I'm opposed to interspecies marriage between pigs and frogs.[6]”When asked in a 2012 interview with IndieLondon, if he would consider representing the Green Party or moving into politics, Kermit said:“Well, listen, I love the fact that there is a Green Party. But I don't think I could actually associate myself with a particular party. I'm kind of a flipper-tarian myself. We believe in taking care of the swamp and more amphibian Americans. That's us.”In a 2012 appearance on Good Morning America, Kermit reported on the 2012 republican primaries - appearing in his reporter garb and looking to interview a newt (Newt Gingrich) and a baseball mitt (Mitt Romney).Kermit appeared on The Colbert Report in March 2012 as Colbert's \"Chief Swampland Political Analyst\" to discuss the 2012 presidential campaign. Kermit was reluctant to take sides with a political party or candidate. \"I'm just a frog...I don't know very much about politics,\" he said. \"Seriously, Stephen, I really don't talk much about politics. I am an amphibitarian. We're not partisan except when it comes to pigs.\" However, Colbert reminded Kermit of his roots as a reporter (and refused to plug Kermit's upcoming DVD and Blu-ray release unless Kermit gave some political analysis); as a result, Kermit gave his views on the 2012 republican primary:“The fact is, Stephen, that this race is far from over. You know, we haven't even hit Romney's strongholds of New York and California yet. And the closer Mitt gets to that magical number of 1,144 delegates, well, the more leverage he has at a hypothetical brokered convention. However! However, you know, if rumors of a Santorum/Gingrich superticket prove true, well, we're in for a hot time in Tampa. How's that?...I just don't take sides, you know, when it comes to politics, I really think everyone, everyone, Democrats, Republicans, the independents, all of them will really enjoy our new movie The Muppets on DVD and Blu-Ray March 20th!”In April 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed Kermit the Frog and the Muppets as New York City's family ambassadors for 2012.In June 2015, during an appearance at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Kermit was asked by Gloria Steinem if he was a feminist; Kermit said he was and Steinem suggested that we need more feminist frogs in Washington, which led Kermit to reveal that he's a member of the Amphibitarian party.Music: \"Up in the Clouds, Where the Rainbows Meet\" by Mitchell from SiIvaGunner: King for Another Day.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":8371,"currentSubscribers":10292,"currentFavorites":427},"id":"2066664783"}

{"title":"Scarlet Devil Mansion","description":"\"The Scarlet Devil Mansion - Remilia's home. From Touhou Project.I'm bad at drawing.\"[Stage original release: 20.05.09]--Overview--The Scarlet Devil Mansion (紅魔館), where most of Touhou Koumakyo (紅魔郷) takes place. Draw elements from the fighting games mostly and the red moon from the original game, but the stage itself meant to represent Koumakyo only.This is my first stage, as so it was given a very basic form, based on the Kalos Stadium from Smash for. The reason I chose the Kalos layout is because I always prefer legal layouts, and the Kalos one seems unique but kind of unused one. So it's its chance to shine, or at least a little more. I really don't think the stage looks any good as it very lacking overall. But I never mind it.  It's simple and with no gimmick at all - just as the game it's based on, and as I like it.[20.12.03]--Features--- Ugly scarlet mist.- Kalos layout. (Aether)- FD layout. (Basic) [Added: v2.0 / 20.05.14]- 4 songs; No remixes, with decent loop though.- Nothing else.--Songs--★ Septet for a Dead Princess (Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) [music_loop]★ U.N.Owen Was Her? (Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) [music_loop2]★ Locked Girl ~ The Girl's Sealed Room (Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) [music_loop3]★ Lunar Clock ~ Luna Dial (Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) [music_loop4]I thought this final choice was \"okay\". Mostly because as the time passed, I start seeing Locked Girl not as good as other songs. In fact, I wanted to add Meiling's theme instead, but I felt the songs need to represent the inside of the mansion (despite my stage bringing you outside of the mansion, technically), that is why I ended up choosing Patchouli's theme instead. I really wanted to bring stage themes too, but I felt the need to represent bosses instead, reason why every song is a boss theme. Adding the fact boss music fits better for battles (obviously), I didn't see reason to bring stage music at the end.[20.12.03 / Edited]--2.0--Because of the recent update, I thought I have to update this. So, I added the Basic form. The original form based on the Kalos League stage remains as the Aether form, while the new Basic just remove the platform, basically creating a Final Destination layout. So it is its Omega form. :T[20.05.14]--3.0--Rework to all the graphics. While almost everything go update, it's the same design. No other changes were made. The layout is the very same, as so is the limit of the stage. And the music is also unchanged; I want to keep it untouched.[20.12.13 / Edited]--Copyright--Original Concept:  © Team Shanghai AliceMusic: © Team Shanghai Alice","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1648845242826755649/D68117C7C45D49CAA04B4505D4D2E84CFF807B92/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":2597,"currentSubscribers":9546,"currentFavorites":295},"id":"2090891406"}

{"title":"TIMECUBE","description":"Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, within a single rotation of Earth, empowers me above all educated stupid scientists. My wisdom so antiquates known knowledge, that a psychiatrist examining my behavior, eccentric by his academic single corner knowledge, knows no course other than to judge me schizoprenic. In today's society of greed, men of word illusion are elected to lead and wise men are condemned. You must establish a Chair of Wisdom to empower Wise Men over the stupid intelligentsia, or perish.*************************************************All creation on Earth exists between the 2 opposite poles, and if unified, would cancel and cease to exist. Humans exist only as opposites - with a zero value, for if unified, male and female would counter each other & cease to exist. Evil educators suppress student free speech right to debate Cubic Creation. Evil students don't object.I have been informed that the academic pedant hirelings are conspiring to defame my character, as a means to discredit the Time/Life/Truth Cube Creation Principle.Hey stupid - are you too dumb to know there are 4 different simultaneous 24 hour days within asingle rotation of Earth? Greenwich 1 day is a lie. 4 quadrants = 4 corners, and 4 different directions. Each Earth corner rotates own separate 24 hour day. Infinite days is stupidity.***********************************Wisdom=Cubic testing of knowledge. Demand right to debate Time Cube, or you are unworthy of life on Earth. I can't believe that stupid students allow suppression of the Time Cube.************************************Evil educators refuse to recognize the wisest of humans to ever exist. My magnificent creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days within a single rotation of Earth, debunks the puny 1-day rotation of stupid educators. Nature has no choice but to bring forth a hell upon evil cubelessness. Know it to be of your own making.******************************************Academia is an accreditation of real stupidity - deadly to all humanity. Teachers fear Time Cubeand will eat dung before debating it. Dumb students are educated stupid.*****************************************I have requested that the UCS, or Union of Concerned Scientists, act to evaluate Nature's Harmonic Time Cube Principle of Creation - for the welfare of children, nature and thefuture of all humanity.  They have ignored their obligation to their humanity fellowship to research Time Cube, and deserve to be spit upon publicly. It is their moral duty to test Time Cube, and a curse of evil if they ignore the greatest discovery of humanity. I have offered $10,000.00 to the evil teachers if they disprove Time Cube.They can't disprove it, so they hide like yellow-bellys they are.***********************************There is no human entity, just human Cubics - as in 4 different people in a 4 corner stage metamorphic rotation - never more than 1 corner at same time.***********************************Academic free speech is a lie. Try to discuss & debate Nature's Time Cube and your evil teachers will not allow you. Ignorance of Time Cube dooms humans, inflicting their own created \"word hell\". Educators are actually \"evil word gods\",teaching commercial plunder of Nature. They suppress free speech, by denying Time Cube debate discussion. Students MUST DEMAND free speech - for the greatest of all human discoveries: Nature's Harmonic Simultaneous 4 Day Rotating Creation Principle of Cubicism.Educated stupid,  you can't know Truth.******************************************I bestow upon myself the \"Doctorate of Cubicism\", for educators are ignorant of Nature's Harmonic Time Cube Principle and cannot bestow the prestigious honor of wisdom upon the wisest human ever.                                           Dr. Gene Ray************************************************************Force teachers to debate Time Cube site. Word teachers are the most evil humans.Religious academia represses the human mind of the Cubic Truth - not utterable. Educators and teachers, ignorant of the Time Cube Principle,  are evil liars and unfit to live in Earth's Garden of Eden. They refuse to challenge this site, repressing Time Cube free speech rights. Students must force Time Cube debates & Make sure every teacher sees this web site.**************************************Since I have informed you of Nature's Harmonic Time Cube 4-Day Creation Principle, your stupidity is no longer the issue.  For now, the issue is just how evil you are for ignoring Life'sHighest Order, and just how long the Time Cube will allow you to plunder Earth before inflicting hell upon you.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1012692419886455298/60C665BFF666EFFCF27ACB857AE38E4B6AF9906A/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":778,"currentSubscribers":1189,"currentFavorites":44},"id":"2095661020"}

{"title":"Sans Boss Fight","description":"Do you wanna have a bad time? Now you can with this faithful recreation of the genocide route Sans boss fight from Undertale!This stage features Sans' full attack sequence as seen in his Undertale boss battle, featuring bones, platforms, gravity changes, more bones, and gaster blasters. Play against a CPU for singleplayer mode, or play with other people and try to survive the longest. Hallway intro, flavour text and Sans' dialogue is included as well for the full genocide route experience.Choose Basic mode for the original Sans battle, or Aether mode to activate an 'Expert mode', where you have less health and can't heal.Obtain input codes for each character by beating the boss fight on Standard mode. Input the code with the character at the beginning of the match to unlock Survival mode, where you have 2x HP, but the attacks come immediately one after another. Last until the end to beat this mode.For starters, Zetterburn's code is: down - up - right - right - left - down - down - up.NOTE: if you find yourself in a black stage with white floor, make sure you are playing in the latest workshop branch, this stage will not work on older branches.------------------------------------------Stage info/mechanics (Mild spoilers below)------------------------------------------The menu system has been altered slightly to accomodate for Rivals mechanics. The fight button allows you to attempt to hit Sans with a hitbox. Act will perform a check on Sans, nothing special. Item will make you consume a food item, in a set order. There is a limited amount of food, the Item option will not be available once you run out. Mercy will do nothing up until the Spare section, in which you can press it to activate the spare sequence.Up to 4 players can play on the stage at once, but any CPU players will be put out of the match, allowing you to play singleplayer.Press taunt during the opening countdown to activate a text skip mode, where some of the opening and spare dialogue will be skipped, reminiscent of how repeat battles against Sans in Undertale have less text.Like what I make?

Another theme is to enjoy the process by which modern people, separated from civilization, reconstruct a civilized society.The PC98 and TOWNS versions have nude events, but in the SFC version, the nude events have been changed to clothing and the lower half of the body cannot be seen. Even so, it's a pretty risqué depiction of sexiness for an SFC softwareIt has been made into a series, and there are many sequels such as the Deserted Island Tale series as a general work, the Deserted Island Tale R series with a romance simulation element, and the adult game Deserted Island Tale X series.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1971,"currentSubscribers":417,"currentFavorites":16},"id":"2116641952"}

Welcome to the Trial Grounds!DON'T FORGET TO CHECK THE KILLING GROUNDS, AN ALTERNATE, CHAOTIC VERSION OF THIS STAGE!This is Monokuma's home stage, featuring stunning visuals, a huge and dynamic sountrack with a new remix, and character compatibility! This is the ideal place for life or death battles, both verbal and physical!The stage has two moving platforms, and both Basic and Aether layouts. The basic layout does not have the gap in the middle, there's nothing on the foreground that potentially blocks the view, and the background portraits move a bit slower.The scenario looks especially cool because DinoBros programmed it so there's more layers than usual, allowing a really pretty parallax effect to happen. Try scrolling the camera!Song SelectionHere's the song list: It's Up for Debate (DR Mix) V3 Discussion - HEAT UP - Danganronpa [2ND GIG] V3 Discussion - PANIC - V3 Discussion - SCRUM - It's a Monokuma World DIVE DRIVE Closing ArgumentAnd you read that right! One of the songs featured in the stage is \"It's Up for Debate\", a song originally composed by Lugitaro for Siivagunner's King for Another Day Tournament. But that's not all! It's a brand new revision of the song with a brand new section, optimized for the stage!\"But how can I choose which song plays on the stage?\".That's simple! Just hold taunt (or the special button) + one of eight directions during the countdown before the match! Holding taunt + up picks It's Up for Debate, and the sequence continues clockwise in the order mentioned above.Also, depending on certain conditions, the songs change mid-match. In most cases, one player has to have only one stock left. V3 Discussion - HEAT UP - changes to V3 Discussion - HOPE VS. DESPAIR -. I won't spoil the other songs!CompatibilityThis stage has character compatibility, which means YOUR character can appear in the monitor whenever it gets KO'd, using the traditional Danganronpa pixel art style!If you'd rather not make the two simple sprites, a placeholder will replace your character. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't like a meaningless death like that!Anyway, there's a tutorial in the discussions section. Extra infoYou can know more about stage by watching Monokuma's Video Presentation, so I highly recommend that you watch it!Most of this stage was programmed by DinoBros, so go check his stuff out!Also, check out Monokuma!And of course, go check out Lugitaro's songs as well, since he made that amazing rendition for the stage!

This stage has a very cute and unique gimmick where you can literally run for as long as you like!Because of the nature of how this stage is designed, some things are gonna differ from your typical platform fighter stage. The camera will try its best to follow all the players at any given point in time, but there's a limit to how fast it can fly, to avoid hurting your eyes. Similarly to subspace emissary from brawl, the camera will also suspend its motion for a brief period while you're in hitstun, allowing you to knock players off the left or right side of the stage.This stage also features an aether variant with some cute little platforms for you to play around with. Also, this stage supports any number of players, so not even some crazy phenomena where dan adds 8 player mode will break my programming :)That being said, because of how this stage is programmed, there'll no doubt be some glaring bugs and differences from regular stages, so please do check up on the bug discussion thread if you find anything. If it's not logged there, feel free to mention it to me, and I'll either try and fix it myself, or explain to you why it's not my fault.All art and programming in this stage was done by me.

{"title":"Cool Milestone Grinding","description":"im lazy sorry. works best with 3 empty players, set them to local players with a random fighter, either by switching them to cpus and back, or manually swapping to that player and picking their fighter.also works with 0.5x knockback which as of version 2.0.5 doubles the amount earned from a kill towards milestones.with you, 3 extra players, and 0.5 knockback, you can set stock to 42 and earn 252 kills towards a milestone which is just above the amount needed :)reason i made this is i believe in 2.0.3 (at least sometime after the initial definitive update) they changed it so increasing knockback decreased the points towards milestones earned from kills. 3.0x would only net you a third of the points for example. so that uh, made grinding a bit harder. find it odd that there wasnt a check for if its set to 0.5x though? cause setting it to THAT just DOUBLES the amount earned.probably calculates it like [number of kills / knockback] so you would end up with [kills / 0.5] which like, if you know math, doubles the amount earned....anyway yeah this just makes it easier to knock players off as soon as possible as well as making it consistent so you can kind of just not think about it and watch a video or something lol","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1533996361160256292/1CFF34B3526CB5EB955438F25205358239CAF1CC/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":298,"currentSubscribers":254,"currentFavorites":8},"id":"2240249598"}

{"title":"Toppat Airship","description":"Duke it out in the bowels of the Toppat Clan's gargantuan aircraft from the third major title in the Henry Stickmin series: Infiltrating the Airship!The Aether form of the stage features two landmasses on either side of the stage which a hovering platform will travel back and forth between throughout the match's duration. The basic form is a single landmass in the center while two hovering platforms on either side of the stage come to the center and back throughout the match's duration. A special cutscene will occur either if the timer runs out on a normal match, or if you taunt during training mode (note, might not work with certain skins that use different taunts).The stage overall is based on the Toppat Clan's Airship from Puffballs United's Infiltrating the Airship (and the soon to release Among Us map based off of it). More particularly, the room featured is the lower engine or \"gap\" room, which is one of the better known locations in the airship as it appears in two of the game's routes.Anything Henry Stickmin related belongs to Puffballs UnitedSpecial thanks to JustZach from Team Art Block for the Airship exterior spriteMusic:Danger Wise - The Henry Stickmin CollectionMushroom Rampage - The Henry Stickmin CollectionThe Airship Themes - The Henry Stickmin Collection","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1665736258498603453/C2F517E38DC0EA064C19B8C3661AD11FB163EFAA/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":15849,"currentSubscribers":53380,"currentFavorites":1803},"id":"2357852962"}

On the Aether version, you get to platform directly on top of their heads, or the logo. Only the top of their heads act as a platform, and both the logo and heads are semi solid platforms, press down too much and you will fall. Battle it out to 4 songs from the album, Buddy Holly, My Name Is Jonas, Undone (The Sweater Song), and Say It Ain't So. Have fun.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1760315309958180027/4C574F3C7A7CD5065930EDF156DDCAFE3F73270E/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1812,"currentSubscribers":4620,"currentFavorites":167},"id":"2399543850"}

{"title":"The Killing Grounds","description":"Before you download this stage, be aware that some elements of the stage can be considered as SPOILERS for many Danganronpa games! So beware!DON'T FORGET TO CHECK THE TRIAL GROUNDS, THE ALTERNATE, TAMER, COMPETITIVE-FRIENDLY VERSION OF THIS STAGE!Let's give it everything we've got! It's Punishment Time! This stage is a hazards version of The Trial Grounds, having the same layout of the Aether version of said stage, including the gap in the middle and the moving platfomrs. But this time, the stage has many executions from the Danganronpa franchise, and even some original ones!Watch out as a total of 10 hazards can come and terrorize you and your opponents, from buzzsaws and spikes to fire trucks and deadly lasers!The monitor in the background will tell you when it's punishment time, and it'll also tell you what hazards is coming to get you, so make sure to pay attention to use this to your advantage! But if you want an even more chaotic experience...Aether modeThis stage's Aether version has two simple gameplay differences from the Basic version: There's no break between hazards! Hazards come out twice as fast, so it's likely that you'll have to deal with two hazards at once!Also, while the Basic version has a slightly more pink and saturated look in comparison to the original Trial Grounds, the Aether version has a grim, desaturated look that's reminiscent from the execution cutscenes from the Danganronpa series! It's like you're really there!Song SelectionThe stage has eight songs to pick from, with a somehow different selection than The Trial Grounds:Here's the song list: It's Up for Debate (DR Mix) The Ultimate Punishment Medley V3 Discussion - Hope vs. Despair The Warriors of Hope V3 Discussion - PANIC - V3 Discussion - SCRUM V3 Rebuttal - CROSS SWORD - Danganronpa [2ND GIG]This time, we have two \"original\" tracks! While one of the songs featured in the stage is still an update version of \"It's Up for Debate\", the song originally composed by Lugitaro for Siivagunner's King for Another Day Tournament, The Ultimate Punishment Medley is a mashup made by me, featuring every punishment song from the series!The in-game vesion is has some cuts to better fit the stage, but you can watch/hear the complete version of the mashup here! But of course, beware of spoilers.And yes, you can still pick what song will play on the stage by holding the taunt or special button + one of eight directions during the countdown before the match! Holding taunt + up picks It's Up for Debate, and the sequence continues clockwise in the order mentioned above.And of course, the songs change mid-match depending on certain conditions. Which songs can you find?CompatibilityLike The Trial Grounds, this stage has character compatibility, which means YOUR character can appear in the monitor whenever it gets KO'd, using the traditional Danganronpa pixel art style!The compatibility is SHARED between stages, so you don't need to code it twice. The same guide will be present in this steam page!If you'd like to let me know your character has compatibility, you can comment here!Extra infoDinoBros helped me a lot with coding, so go check his stuff out!Also, check out Monokuma!And of course, go check out Lugitaro's songs as well, since he made that amazing rendition for the stage!

{"title":"Sacred Summit","description":"Deep within the mountains of Aether, there lies a sacred place, a training ground for those able to brave the storm and climb to the mountain's summit. Those who go up rarely come down- in one piece.- - - - -Sacred Summit is a somewhat experimental stage that has... unique blast-zones, to say the least. Not only is the top platform almost necessary to secure an early kill, but the bottom blast-zone is so low that it can take several spikes to kill confirm an opponent.This stage was made with Hodan and Sylvanos in mind specifically, meaning that the side platforms are basically perfect for their large UStrongs, and their incredible recoveries benefit greatly from the low blast-zone, as it gives them a second chance to recover. Ori is notably at a disadvantage on this stage.I hope y'all enjoy playing this stage as much as I enjoyed making it! :D- - - - -Music is, again, base game music. Rivals style music is more difficult to get right than I expected lol. If I ever get around to making a track for this stage, I'll be sure to update the stage accordingly.- - - - -There's an Aether Mode out now! As opposed to the original stage, recovery doesn't matter on this aether form, since the stage is now almost completely flat! There are some platforms to help with off-the-top kills, though.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1752442811183792208/8C2FADA09B280DB99EE1C12AA16927BF8B95F3B5/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":688,"currentSubscribers":1225,"currentFavorites":54},"id":"2491950047"}

Is this the end of his story?The Leviathan's heart was claimed by the people of Dankwell, directly after that the construction of the Stoneborn tower had begon.17 years later the tower had been completed.This structure was created to harness the power of the Leviathan's heart and reverse the fossilisation of the former inhabitons of Dankwell.This stage also has a unique Aether form! We plan to add compatibility later, so that you guys can send us characters to add to the stage and appear randomly in the background!

{"title":"27 Durdam Lane","description":"Eddsworld spins its way into Rivals of Aether with the all-new 27 Durdam Lane stage! Battle it out on the main cast's roof, a staple of Edd Gould's endearing and hilarious animations.Back in 2003, Edd Gould began creating cartoons of himself and his friends, where he stars Thomas 'TomSka' Ridgewell and Matt Hargreaves primarily. He grew massive attention after moving from Newgrounds to YouTube, growing his channel while doing what he loved.Sadly, however, Edd Gould was diagnosed with Leukemia, and passed in 2012.Although Edd was gone, this did not mean the end for his show. Tom and Matt planned to keep Edd's world turning with Eddsworld Legacy, a campaign that raised over 50,000 British pounds. With the fan base supportive as ever, Eddisodes and shorts were created until 2016 when \"The End\" had been completed. Tom then handed the control of the Eddsworld channel back over to Edd's family.It wasn't until August of 2020 when Matt Hargreaves brought new content to the channel with the introduction of Eddsworld Beyond. A new team is currently working on animations for the long-time fans of the series, along with an incredible surge of new ones, never seen before in Eddsworld history! This is thanks to the extremely popular rhythm game, Friday Night Funkin', and the mods created within the game that involve the show.With Eddsword's new audience and the creation of Eddsworld Beyond, I thought it would be a great time to introduce this stage to one of my favorite games. That being said, please go and support the Eddsworld channel on YouTube! Matt Hargreaves is putting lots of effort in to produce more content for the show's growing fan base!https://www.youtube.com/user/eddsworldFeatured Songs and the Eddisodes they are Found In:- Coco, by High Five Spaceship (Christopher Bingham)This song plays during the credits at the end of Hammer and Fail (Part 1).- Fun Dead Theme, by The Living TombstoneFeatured towards the beginning of the Legacy episode, Fun Dead.- Rocket, by Kevin MacLeodPlayed during the chase scene in WTFuture.- Space Face (Part 2) Theme, by LilDeuceDeuceSong used during the joyride scene and the end credits of the first Eddisode of the Legacy era, Space Face (Part 2).Characters Used in Thumbnail:-Senpai, by onionring1403-asdfguy, by CircleGuyThanks for subscribing to my stage!

The reflections only show in the aether version, as it might produce lag for some people.Technical DifficultiesUnfortunately I couldn't figure out how to make the player reflections work with alt colors palettes.

After the update the sprites were erased for some reason, so I took down the stage to re-add them (and resprited the flag a bit), so if you are experiencing issues with the stage, please try to download it again! Dead Cells comes to Rivals of Aether! From the hit indie game Dead Cells, the Ramparts are here, complete with their signature views and ruins of the Prison.And this time you don't have to worry about having to start over if you happen to fall. What does this stage offer? The chance of fighting on a stage based on one of the best indie games of all time, of course.Also, unlike my previous stage I made a proper parallax effect, along with some little animations.Included you'll find two songs, directly from Dead Cells: Prison's Rooftops as well as the Demake version of that track. Why did you choose The Ramparts to represent Dead Cells? In addition to being an amazing looking biome, it's one of the stages that most players will definitely come across in their first runs. But the biggest reason comes down to the fact that it's the only (I think?) biome in Dead Cells where you can fall off the screen, fitting nicely in a platform fighter.That's all, I hope you enjoy!","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1706287323648508364/93DD63A4F5E3E835B9638CD8E8815FD437E60DF2/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1857,"currentSubscribers":4116,"currentFavorites":155},"id":"2568558950"}

If P1 got hit most recently, it creeps right (more \"night\", bigger plat); if P2 got hit last, it creeps left (\"day\" / no plat).Also, when a player dies, the day and night halves swap between the left and right halves. (P1 is still on the left, P2 is still on the right)NOTE: If the player ports used are not specifically P1 and P2, it treats the furthest-left player port as \"P1\", and the furthest-right as \"P2\". (e.g. in a P2-P3-P4 match, P2 and P4 are used)If you're playing on the Aether form, you REALLY need to be careful... if the border reaches its limit before you can hit the enemy and reverse it, you'll be KO'd!Socials, discord, Patreon (sneak peeks) at https://byMuno.com.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":9526,"currentSubscribers":31447,"currentFavorites":903},"id":"2576190433"}

Therefore the main focus was on a natural day-night cycle inspired by the Animal Crossing games.

Here you won't be able to see much of a visual change while playing, but the music will be different every hour. In Aether Mode the time is accelerated meaning you can observe the sun moving during a match.MiscThere are still a lot of thing I wanted to add, like different weather conditions, dynamic object shadows or just different fruits on the tree. But for now the stage will stay in the state of submission to the Workshop contest. Oh and someone should feel forced to make a Villager character now :)I do not own Animal Crossing.

Also this is one of my best stages. I really like Nintendo Land too but IMO I outdid myself on the background.Since it's going to be Treetop later, I made the layout what I like to call \"Treetop but Epic\". I hate Treetop and that's mostly just because I don't like low platforms, so the left plat is raised up. Other than that the plats are the same size, the right plat is the same height, the ground is the same width, and hell even the blast zones are copied.

{"title":"Dragon Valley","description":"Freedom Planet's Dragon Valley level based on a layout from Indie Pogo. Home to Lilac the Dragon Girl and Carol the Wildcat. This stage was originally made as part of an effort to give Indie games stages that haven't had them in Rivals yet. The original game is arguably better than 90% of Sonic games and the sequel is apparently even better, though I have yet to play it myself. This stage is the series' equivalent of Green Hill Zone.Also comes in Aether mode so the stage can be as competitive or as casual as you want.This stage has been updated as of 19th November 2022, the Aether mode has been completely redesigned from the ground up to be more speed based as befitting of the game it came from and it warps you to the other side of the stage unless you're in hitstun.Also the stage now has support for 10 music tracks with two only playing if you select certain characters. Big thanks to ATalksToSelf for getting this thing set up.Music used:Dragon Valley 1 (Shield plus Up to select)Dragon Valley 2 (Shield plus Down to select)Mid-Boss (Shield plus Taunt to select)Boss 1 (Shield plus Right to select)Basic Tutorial (Freedom Planet 2)Main Menu (Freedom Planet 2)Dragon Valley (FP2) (Shield plus Left to select)Boss 1 (Freedom Planet 2) (Shield plus Attack to select)Lilac's Theme (Freedom Planet 2) - This tune only plays on the stage if you pick Lilac as a fighter (works with all Lilacs on Workshop)Carol's Theme (Freedom Planet 2) - This tune only plays on the stage if you pick Carol as a fighterOriginal composer: Leila WilsonMods used in images:Lilac: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697174282Carol: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782300518Sonic: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039831352","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1865067043123904823/5B724D3E352DC05EAC53C8009AD9D54DB3221A05/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1385,"currentSubscribers":4340,"currentFavorites":121},"id":"2659010360"}

{"title":"Raccoon City Rooftop","description":"A condemned building in the middle of construction during a zombie outbreak? Obviously a very safe place to go! This stage is based off the rooftop from the 2020 remake of RESIDENT EVIL 3 where a particularly arsonistic Nemesis was fought. One of the more memorable set pieces from the mixed bag that was RE3Make.This is my first workshop stage, and honestly this was really fun to learn! It's layout is simple, slightly larger than the average stage. The girders towards the center act as a singular platform. The night sky was heavily edited from an RPG Maker MV asset. The background of the actual city itself was heavily modified from a shot of Raccoon City. The stage itself, however, was done almost entirely from scratch by me.This stage comes with four music tracks:\"Unstoppable Nemesis\" - RESIDENT EVIL 3 NEMESIS\"Unstoppable Nemesis\" - Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3\"Nemesis Theme\" - Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite\"Fighting in the Flames\" - RESIDENT EVIL 3 (2020)UPDATE: Nemesis is finally on the workshop! Although... not made by me. Still.

Modified to fit more with Rivals, of course.This stage comes with four music tracks:\"J-E-N-O-V-A\" - FINAL FANTASY VII\"Jenova Absolute\" - FINAL FANTASY VII\"Birth of a God\" - FINAL FANTASY VII\"One-Winged Angel\" - FINAL FANTASY VIIAll of the tracks above are the original versions from FFVII on the PS1. They're all properly looped too!","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1856044623158373393/C392984B814429DAF6E430BED2482ACDD0FDE302/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":5975,"currentSubscribers":19735,"currentFavorites":643},"id":"2691829137"}

{"title":"Boom Town","description":"From LittleBigPlanet, blast your foes away in scenic Boom Town, located in the Canyons! In basic mode, it's simple ground plus an extended soft platform above it in the form of several houses. In Aether mode, an additional house is added, with Calavera the Wrestler dancing on top of it. Attacking him will make him... *ahem* ...pass gas. It also adds 5 frames of hitpause for the technical types. About 25 seconds into the match on Aether mode, Sheriff Zapata, the scourge of the Canyons, will show up and start throwing bombs at the arena for another 20 seconds before leaving and starting the cycle all over again. Put your bomb survival skills to the test with two different types of bombs: Impact Explosives explode as soon as it touches the ground or your fellow rivals. Timed Explosives explode about 4-5 seconds after they spawn and can be launched towards other fighters, allowing potential for crazy setups. Both explosives deal 10 damage as soon as they explode.Music tracks included are:- The Canyons INT by Mat Clark - LittleBigPlanet- Cornman by Kinky - LittleBigPlanet- The Canyons Rework by Mat Clark and Richard Jacques - LittleBigPlanet Karting- Immovil by Kinky - LittleBigPlanet KartingThought I'd end the year with my second stage and my first trek into stage scripting.

This requires attacking them a couple of times.Basic ModeIn this mode you can play on the Tetris board while an AI will place the pieces automatically. To ensure a fun experience there is a height limit for the Tetris pieces. If the AI stacks higher than this the board will reset. In a similar fashion an fps cap is inplace to ensure that they game doesn't drop below 60 fps.Aether ModeThis mode lets player 1 take control over the Tetris board. This comes with most of the functionality you would expect from a Tetris game. There is a score, level system and a top out (reaching the top of the screen with your pieces) will result in you losing a stock.MusicTetris 99 - Main ThemeTetris 99 OST- Tetris 99 Theme (50 Players)Tetris 99 OST- Tetris 99 Theme (10 Players)Tetris 99 - Main Theme (AWS Remix)Ghost & Kozmos - Tetris Theme [Electro Swing Remix]I do not own Tetris.

{"title":"Night Walk","description":" Nothing like a stroll at night. Inspired by the credits from Rhythm Heaven Fever, this is a casual auto-scrolling stage made entirely of moving platforms.In Basic mode, there is one path, while Aether mode increases it to four.The music is the English version of 'Dreams of Our Generation', by Tsunku♂. The instrumental version plays by default, but the English vocals can be played instead by holding ATTACK and SPECIAL as the match begins.Known bugs:- The lowest path doesn't support articles (It's made of solid blocks rather than platforms): I know about this problem, and it was a necessary compromise to allow down-specials without SDs. This means that characters with floor articles will struggle on this stage.P.S: I know it has a different background from the original. I thought it would look quite nice.Feel free to leave a comment!","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":543,"currentSubscribers":992,"currentFavorites":26},"id":"2824156963"}

Unbeknownst to everyone, the fate of the volcano has been seemingly placed in the hands of a recently minted lava hedgehog, who was, at first, destined to be its guardian. However, circumstances had it so that the hedgehog long abandoned his post, in order to search for a new, more efficient purpose in his dull life. Now being left completely unguarded, nothing can stop anyone from entering the volcano and doing whatever they pleased, or in this case, having a good ole round of fisticuffs right above the boiling hot magma resting within the depths. -Stage sprites done by me and HemuthStage music done by NitroAnilin","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1938254341994693642/0540576567F9598400BABAFEC7085C0858934DCA/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1697,"currentSubscribers":3171,"currentFavorites":82},"id":"2838050130"}

{"title":"Flipnote Studio","description":"With Flipnote Studio, bring your ideas to life! While fighting on this stage, animations will play on the little screen in the back. What plays entirely depends on the characters you're playing with.(I can't believe that after 2 years, the stage is finally out along with it's animation gimmick! Special thanks to Reaver of Souls who volunteered their time to help code this stage.)▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬This stage has character compatibility!Essentially, you can make up to 4 Flipnote animations per character. The way you code this is actually quite simple. But first, before I explain how to code this, I must first tell you the canvas size.Each Flipnote must be drawn at a size of 190x126. Once you are finished animating your Flipnote, export it at double the size. Your Flipnote animation should now be at 380x252 after exporting. This also goes without saying, your animation should be in the form of a strip file. It doesn't matter what you name the strip file as long as you have _strip# at the end of the strip's file name.---------------In order to make a custom Flipnote for your character, insert this bit of coding into your character's init.gml file:fns_note1 = sprite_get(\" \");fns_note_speed1 = 10/60;fns_note_runtime1 = 0;fns_note_sound1 = noone;Notice how fns_note, fns_note_speed, fns_note_runtime, & fns_note_sound all end with 1? This signifies that these all work together to create one custom Flipnote animation for the character. Simply replace 1 with 2, 3, or 4 to make more Flipnotes for your character(s)!fns_note2 = sprite_get(\" \");fns_note_speed2 = 10/60;fns_note_runtime2 = 0;fns_note_sound2 = noone;fns_note3 = sprite_get(\" \");fns_note_speed3 = 10/60;fns_note_runtime3 = 0;fns_note_sound3 = noone;fns_note4 = sprite_get(\" \");fns_note_speed4 = 10/60;fns_note_runtime4 = 0;fns_note_sound4 = noone;---------------Allow me to explain what each thing means• fns_note allows you to tell the stage what animation you want to be presented on the screen.• fns_note_speed allows you to set the speed at which the animation plays. This is done in Frames-per-Second.• fns_note_runtime determines how long the animation will play for in frames. If you set this to a value higher than how many frames the animation actually has, this will cause the animation to loop.• fns_note_sound allows you to tell the stage what sound you want to be played with the animation. If you don't want sound accompanying your animation, set the value as noone. If you want sound, use the command sound_get(\" \");, then insert what sound file you want played.---------------And one last thing to keep in mind:Animations are played at random, not in a set rotation. Keep this in-mind when trying to watch your own custom Flipnotes on the screen.Also, as far as I'm aware, there is no limit to how many frames an animation can have. For example, the Parade sample Flipnote has a whopping 193 frames of animation.Happy animating!---------------For more info on creating custom Flipnotes, view \"read_me.gml\" in the stage's files.▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Want to make your Flipnote animations more authentic? Here are some tips:• Find a Flipnote Studio brush set for your drawing program of choice. (I actually made my own Flipnote Studio brush set for FireAlpaca (a free drawing program). Find it here: https://www.deviantart.com/real-angelthegamer/art/Flipnote-Studio-3D-Brushes-FireAlpaca-927304494).• Don't use any transparency in your animation.• If your drawing program uses Anti-Aliasing, turn it off.• Limit yourselves to the official 6 Flipnote Studio colors (not including Orange).• Set your animation speed to an official Flipnote speed: https://flipnote.fandom.com/wiki/Flipnote_Speed▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Do you have a character that has custom Flipnotes?

{"title":"Frozen Sanctuary","description":" Frozen Sanctuary  [Definitive Edition]  A re-imagining of Torga's original stage Frozen Sanctuary. Now with a better color palette, more interesting plat layout, and is a better fit for the characterThe Frozen Sanctuary is one of many outposts created by the Aether Chelodians (Turtles). These structures were erected to house and encourage meditation for the numerous diligent monks that roamed from temple to temple. They are used as benchmarks for which locations have been overrun by The Fire. When the forest began to seek revenge, it was too used to communicate what Sylvanos had done to the land. Over time, many outposts began to fall, with the strength found in the forest and fire being an unstoppable force, only few remained. The Frozen Sanctuary, amongst a land too cold to sustain a flame, and dirt too unyielding to see a flower bloom. This is where Torga resides, in a paradise for him and him aloneThe perfect peace of the land, such perfection for the peace and quiet that was ever so loved by the monks. That was until others began to seek this paradise for themselves. The Fire Empire and Forest have ravaged and terrorized so many towns beloved by their people, and people began to seek shelter elsewhere. In the hills of this barren wasteland was just enough to sustain the lives of the few that had found their way. But as more and more began to build their homes, there was less and less resources to go around. And just like that... people got greedy. Fathers and mothers came from their small, cold cabins to fight for their children. Pillaging other homes for their food, slaying innocent men and women for what little they had.There was no stopping this all-out-warfare once it started. Soon everyone was on edge, there was nowhere safe to hide. That was until a group of scared villagers banded together to build the biggest and warmest cathedral-esque stronghold ever constructed in these fear-driven mountains. To fight off those seeking to use what they built for their own self-gain, they built weapons. Cannons, crossbows, primitive muskets, anything to protect their home. Soon, their beautiful building began to grow dull... After standing the barrage of desperate people grasping for new hope, they began to realize that they had not built a paradise. No, they had built their own prison, forever doomed to protect and hide. After many years and many lives lost, the stronghold grew quiet. The torches extinguished, food rotten, and water turned murky... Nobody was left, just silenceTorga, from his sanctuary, did nothing. A once noble turtle, brought to his knees and wept... He had sworn an oath against violence, but now it was too late...He would not let that mistake happen again.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1779505671974773570/123336D3B5A5A06916B87684ED38EDEC12733770/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":4351,"currentSubscribers":10375,"currentFavorites":262},"id":"2853558039"}

{"title":"LEGO Land","description":"A world built from endless creativity!LEGO LandBased on retro LEGO themes such as LEGO Town comes LEGO Land! It features six different layouts randomly chosen at the start of a match and an Aether Mode with more... realistic LEGO bricks.BasicSimilar to various LEGO sets, LEGO Land comes with extra pieces allowing for different variations on the default build. In the case of LEGO Land, this allows for six unique platform layouts, with one of them randomly picked at the start of the match. The layouts are as follows and can be seen in the item images above.- Single platform- Twin platforms- Triple platforms (features the twin platforms and a higher middle one)- Ledge platforms (similar to Spirit Tree)- Off-stage mushroom platforms (two larger platforms off the sides of the stage)- Reverse triple platforms (similar to the triple platform layout but the side platforms are higher. The middle platform is as large as the off-stage platforms while the side platforms are smaller)AetherAether Mode is fairly close to Basic Mode, however, the exposed studs from the LEGO bricks forming the ground now deal damage upon contact. Various warning signs have been added to the stage to warn those unaware. The different damage triggers are as follows:- Walking (1% over time)- Dashing/Running (1% over time, deals damage faster then walking)- Landing (3% per landing)- Landing in pratfall/Parried state (2% per landing, will trigger a few times upon getting parried)- Wave landing (1% per landing)- Rolling (1% per roll)MusicLEGO Land features 9 different music tracks from various LEGO games, with an indicator appearing in the top left of the screen at the start of the match with the song name, artist, source game or album, and the album art or game cover!Tired of randomization and want to select the song yourself? Four songs are available for selection by holding shield and the correct direction on the left stick, right stick, and their keyboard counterparts during the start of the match! - LEGO Island Theme (LEGO Island - The Complete Soundtrack) [Option 1: Up]- Happy Roaming (LEGO Island - The Complete Soundtrack)- The Race (LEGO Island - The Complete Soundtrack)- Main Menu (LEGO Racers) [Option 2: Right]- Knightmare-athon (LEGO Racers)- Sandy Bay (LEGO Racers 2)- Xalax (LEGO Racers 2)- Blue Room (Main Theme) (Island XTreme Stunts Original Soundtrack) [Option 3: Down]- Cannon Cove (LEGO Universe Original Game Soundtrack) [Option 4: Left]ExtrasWant to use one of the custom colors from the images above?

{"title":"Omori Battle","description":"Join OMORI and friends as they face off against various foes.Which boss OMORI and friends face, and therefore what music is playing, is randomized. If you wish to decide the boss and music, press special or taunt and press a direction at the start of the match - Up: FOREST BUNNY and SPROUT MOLE (Tussle Among Trees) - Up-Right: PLUTO (THE VENGENCE FOR THOSE FORGOTTEN IN THE DARKNESS - Right: DOWNLOAD WINDOW (CHAOS ASSEMBLY) - Down-Right: SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND (You Were Wrong. Turn Back) - Down: SWEETHEART (World's End Valentine) - Down-Left: MR. JAWSUM (Jawbreaker) - Left: EXPANDED PLUTO (GOLDENVENGENCE) - Up-Left: SLIME GIRLS (Underwater Prom Queens) - No direction: Unbread Twins (BREADY STEADY GO)Each dream friend is assigned a player. OMORI is player 1, KEL is player 2, AUBREY is player 3, and HERO is player 4. Whenever you get a kill or taunt, your assigned friend will become HAPPY. If you get killed, they'll become SAD or ANGRY. If you lose your last stock, they'll become TOAST! If a dream friend doesn't have an assigned player, they'll get a random emotion whenever someone dies.If any base cast character, Gudua, or Sandbert is in battle, their corresponding dream friend will be replaced with portraits representing the character. Workshop creators can add their own portraits as well! If you'd like to add your own portraits, check out the compatibility guide discussion.If OMORI (by circleguy) is in the battle, instead of getting emotions based on kills/deaths, OMORI's battle portrait will be the same as the character's emotion buff.If you're lucky (or play as BASIL by circleguy), you'll see OMORI and BASIL team up to face the bosses.If KEL (by Aperson) is in the match, any opponents affected by his emotions will have their portraits changed to that emotion. If they aren't affected by Kel's emotions, they will react to kills, deaths, and taunts as normal.Sweetheart (by Specter) functions similarly to Kel, making opponents angry will change their portraits, and her portrait will change when she becomes happy.When Watermimic (by V_force) is in the match, it will be the enemy that appears in the background. It will change emotions just like if it were a battle portrait. You can use RNG override to fight against one of the normal stage bosses instead.When SOMETHING (by me) is in the match, the fight will be Sunny in his final confrontation against SOMETHING. It will periodically switch between the main SOMETHING, and the variants faced throughout the game. You can use RNG override as normal, but you have to do it before the match loads in.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1831297779450177008/06A8A84CA87D49851AECA7E28EF091A4EC3C1E76/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":4221,"currentSubscribers":6997,"currentFavorites":227},"id":"2859177822"}

Both of the side roofs and the top arch can be stood on, serving as a perfect viewing point to stare off into the endless sea of clouds surrounding the mountain. Can you spot the Destiny's Bounty in the background?AetherWhile Basic Mode takes place during sunrise with a brilliant orange sky, Aether Mode features a mid-day blue! The Monastery also takes on its ruined appearance from Season 6, Day of the Departed, and Season 7 after its destruction at the hands of the Hypnobrai in Season 1.

(Nokia Ringtone but Smash Mouth All Star)Also, if it wasn't obvious, Silvagunner is the creator of these rips. I take no credit, yada yada yada.Ok, fine, the reason Aether mode sucks is because I couldn't figure out how to turn off the platforms, so I replaced all files for platforms with a png of a Freddy Fazbear plush. This, however, broke the platforms entirely, so I should warn you of minor flashing lights. Also, instead of the ground being a flat stage, I mapped it around the basic shape of Freddy, so good luck getting around him to the other side to fight someone.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":2645,"currentSubscribers":2043,"currentFavorites":52},"id":"2881852699"}

(poor orcane)Aether Version: Based on a segment from the first level in the game, complete with ladders and an item shop.Music: Slash Man's Stage from Mega Man 7 (The original game didn't have any music, so I just went with this.)AboutUsed to play this game a ton on my dad's phone when I was younger but I could never remember what it was called. Was like a looming mystery to me for years. Finally rediscovered the game some months ago though and I thought of making a stage out of it recently, so here we are.The original game didn't have music, so I decided to go with Slash Man's theme since I had a similar story with that track too. Used to hear it a ton in flash games I grew up on but never knew what the track was called or how to even find it until I played Mega Man 7 for the first time a couple years ago. So I guess including the track was more of a personal thing for me, but I think it fits the stage.CreditsChitatel from Spriter's Resource - Ripped most of the tilesets that were used for the stage. wait4u and amusingware - Original publisher and developer of the game.ps: this is probably one of the nichest ways you'll ever unlock a memory.also ps: staying up late just to finish the title screen thumbnail was a mistake. go to bed early y'all.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1866205964318648892/DF1B5E95666D6A8D9B41836F3EB98DF92C8E846C/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":493,"currentSubscribers":766,"currentFavorites":16},"id":"2882379847"}

The net doesn't cause fouls or lets and is only there for decoration.Be careful when hitting the ball because you can only touch the ball 5 times before the opponent touches it; otherwise, you get a foul.The preferred ruleset is a First to 11, which is accessed by keeping the default stocks at 3 or setting the stock count to 11.If you wish to play a different ruleset, you can set the stock count to what you desire to score to or open up the Custom Menu.Stray far from the net if you don't wish to get hit by the opponent if they have long-ranged attacks, but you don't have to worry about projectiles or articles coming across the net.Projectiles and Base Cast articles get destroyed/pushed when they cross the line.The optional menu is accessed by pressing Shield + Taunt before the Volleyball is in play.The customization options include Music, Stages, Aether Modifiers, and Randomizing Teams.Aether Mode puts two random modifiers in play each time a point is scored.Be careful avoiding hitting your allies because damage does not get reset in between points.I may add more stages, music, and aether mode modifiers later in future updates.Art Credits:\t-Regina: WS Volleyball Court and Preview ImageMusic Credits:\t-Delta Parralax:\t--\tEnter the Derby\t--\tAmbrosian Vibrancy (with permission from Reiga)\t--\tReel Em In!\t--\tScares and Scars\t\tTournament Standards:\tBest of 3\tFirst to 11\t\tTop 8:\tBest of 5\tFirst to 11\tUsing the option menu is prohibited unless both players agree to it.Basic Mode with No Modifiers\t\tNotes: Grabs do not work if they use hit_player.gml to activate them so use the following variables to add support.\tVolleyball Variables for Devs to add any Compat:volleyball_id //Id of the Volleyball itself.has_hit_ball //when the player has hit the ball this will be true. \t\t","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1893228189116681733/3B45994FECF4AA56F3BFB39741F40D86D2A7ABCB/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":6819,"currentSubscribers":7848,"currentFavorites":234},"id":"2885762704"}

{"title":"Going Merry","description":"The beloved caravel of the Straw Hat Pirates, sailing on a voyage that spanned from the East Blue and into the treacherous waters of the Grand Line. An iconic set piece from the One Piece manga.Stage InfoA pirate ship with a tall figure head that serves as both a wall and \"cliff\" on the leftmost part of the stage. A decline is placed in the middle of the stage and has two small spots that are hidden by the foreground. The rightmost part of the stage is blocked by a small wall for the back rails of the ship, and also houses a platform on top of the meeting room. At the top of the stage lies another platform atop the mast.Basic Mode: Based on Oda's color scheme (Manga)Aether Mode: Based on Toei's color scheme (Anime)Music: We Are! (Instrumental Version)RambleFinally have half of my OP project finished! I'm uploading it now as a standalone stage, but you could consider this the home stage for the Luffy mod I'm currently working on.This is probably the most fun I've had working on a mod so far and I really like how the stage came out for the most part. To be real I am a liittle iffy on how the jolly roger (the skull on the flag) looks and the jaggy lines for the sail ropes do stand out but... I'm happy with how it turned out!Thankfully I already made a stage like Kame House earlier so I was able to reuse the ocean animation from there rather than worrying about having to make one from scratch. The wave in the foreground was still a challenge though. I was considering just giving up on it and just leaving it as is, but it just wouldn't look right. The wave animation isn't the smoothest, but I did try, and I think that's what matters in the end.Been slowly edging away at my Luffy mod for a while, just getting small bits here and there until I can really start working on it during winter break. Mostly just done rescaled/edited sprites from existing sheet for the moves that fall in line with my planned moveset doc, but I've started doing the animations for a couple attacks that weren't on the sheet as well. Still ain't the best with animation, but I think working on projects for stuff I'm actually passionate about is the best way to go about learning these things. Just gotta push through.I can't guarantee it'll turn out super good like all the cool stuff that's been released on the workshop these past few years but I'll try my best. Already this part of the overall project done, just gotta take care of finishing Luff now.also writing this now i just realized i was supposed to sneak guadua in the screenshots as a pandaman reference but i completely forgot!!oh wellCredits Something With Music (Uploading the We Are instrumental.

{"title":"Pokémon World Tournament","description":"Also known as the PWT, it's the battlefield where legends clash! With over 320 layout combining every Pokémon type, this stage is guaranteed to keep you on your toes. Trainers from all over the world go to Driftveil City in the Unova region to compete in this arena, and so can you! From time to time, the big monitor will randomly select one Pokémon, and change the layout of the stage based this Pokémon's types! Most of the time, the primary type will define the layout of the *left* side of the stage, while the secondary type will define the layout of the *right* side of the stage! If the Pokémon is monotype, both sides will have the same layout.However, this isn't the rule, because some type combinations currently do not exist! So I had to take liberties, sorry about that. You may see unual stuff such as Rock/Ghost Cursola thanks to that. Pokémon galore! The Aether version of the stage adds Pokémon cameos! There are over 60 of them, and they're all made by workshop devs! Some of them come from existing mods, while some are brand new! This is truly a celebration of both Pokémon and the RoA workshop as a whole!There's at least 3 Pokémon per layout, so there are always at least 6 Pokémon on stage. In cases where there are many Pokemon representing a single type, I made it so some of them only appear on one specific side of the stage. All the cameos are authorized by the original artists/devs, and I'll credit them accordingly!

Stage sprites were ripped by them as well. (.swf file was archived by them too)Original track featured is Green Beginnings by JaxX.

Songs are selected at the beginning of the match by moving the c-stick in one of the following directions:Up: Luffy VS Ratchet (Round 1)Down: Spirited Swordsman ZoroLeft: Giant Stronghold, Takeoff!Right: Karakuri Castle, Transform(note: some of these tracks were originally made for the movie scores before eventually being reused in the anime in different contexts, so the names might not match the scenes you associate these particular tracks with. i included hyperlinks in case you want to check out what each of the tracks sound like!)Ramblegetting closer to finishing luffy!!at the moment I'd say he's close to... 70% done? somewhere around that, i don't rlly have a proper measuring system for these estimatesjust need to get f-tilt, u-tilt, d-strong, and both f-specials done. then i need to finish the animation wips for some of the moves, program d-special, and do the rest of the movement/misc. animations i'm missing. after that, it's smooth sailing and i just have to do balancing and some extra art stuff i wanna do. (also additional disclaimer: luff uses a mix of heavily edited sprites from grand battle: swan colosseum, in addition to a bunch of custom anims i've been working on. the nair frame from the basic layout thumbnail was done by me, but the dair frame in the aether thumbnail is from the swan colosseum game. just thought i'd put that out there since i don't want to make it look like that was mine!)this here was the last little side project i was working on before i got on break and started prioritizing luffy. been taking a lil break from working on luff since i got burned out a while ago, so i decided to finish this up. (don't want another project ending up in wip limbo 😔)anyways if you're reading this rn and currently experiencing burnout, don't be afraid to take a break. no need to feel guilty over not being productive either. your #1 mission rn is to get some rest and take back your sanity!!hope this helps the 0 people reading the ramble section.

Must be close to Lilac's treehouse!BasicBasic Mode features a twin platform layout on a fairly large ground, giving plenty of space for faster characters to run.

MusicFeaturing music from both Freedom Planet games, Dragon Valley has a wide selection of song options! Do you prefer to jam out to the jazzy Dragon Valley remix, crush your foes as they hear boss music, or simply relax as Lilac's Theme plays?

{"title":"Enter the Golden House (VS.

{"title":"Wandering Skies","description":"Battle at the upmost pinnacle of the lands of AetherA blazing sun sets over the highest point in all the land, blanketed by a sea of endless clouds. At its peak lies the forgotten remains of an old battle against a truly monstrous beast, with a truly titanic spear and sword stabbed through the ancient skull being the only remnants of a pair of great heroes long since passed. The mystic master of air, Uysal, comes to this place often to meditate as the sun dips below the horizon, pondering over the fates of those two warriors he fought along side long ago.A stage companion to Uysal, the Patient Gale, with a stage layout inspired directly off of the boss arenas for Galeem and Dharkon. I’ve had the concept for this stage for 4 years at this point, so I hope you enjoy this gorgeous sunset in your own battles.CreditsInitial Concept, Art, and Implementation: ArtistOfSeerStage Theme: Delta Parallax","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":3003,"currentSubscribers":7927,"currentFavorites":231},"id":"2946045555"}

{"title":"CH Shinjuku Station","description":"A stage based on City Hunter and the iconic Shinjuku Station, a location featured prominently in the franchise. I designed the stage after the real-life station's Eastern Exit, but I tried to make it look as close as possible to its appearance in the original '80s anime series (with a small nod to Angel Heart). I implemented a scrolling collection of three artworks drawn by author and illustrator, Tsukasa Hojo, to showcase some of his iconic artwork for the franchise. The stage itself features a three floating platforms with generous blast zones. I sprited most of the stage on my own over the course of 33 hours, so I think it was well worth the wait. And with that, this is now the seventh stage that I've made to be part of the OVA Applia Stage collection. I hope you enjoy it!Music Used:1.

{"title":"KOR Abcb Café","description":"A small stage based on an iconic location from the Kimagure Orange Road franchise. The stage has a few platforms: the brick wall, the middle section of the cafe, and the roof. I used elements from multiple depictions of the iconic café, taking more inspiration from the anime series. This is the first of my stages to include a proper Aether variant of the stage. Set at a sunset, the Aether variant extends the main platform to each blast zone while still including the original platforms from the base stage. With that said, I may look into adding an Aether variant to all of the previous stages I've released. This is now the ninth stage that I've made to be part of the OVA Applia Stage collection. Shoutouts to everyone who gave me feedback on making this stage look as great as possible. I hope you enjoy it!Music Used:1.

Fight for the future of Hyrule in Ganondorf 's very own stage, inspired by his boss fight in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time!In the basic version of this stage, with aesthetics reminiscent of Ocarina of Time 3d, fighters who lose all their stocks get trapped in a crystal, just like Zelda in OoT. This feature works in battles with 2, 3 or 4 players!But in the Aether version, more inspired by the original Nintendo 64 boss battle, not only will the imprisonment still happen, but the ground, which initially covers the whole screen, will slowly fall! By the end of this cycle, only a small area remains, so watch out! However, the Aether version still has one trick upon its sleeve: in a final stocks situation, the whole additional ground will colllapse at once! The Triforce of Power will not let anyone have it easy inside its domain.This stage is compatible with Hyuponia's Music Select template, with the following songs available:- Ganondorf Battle (Ocarina of Time)- Silent Guardians (Hyrule Warriors)- Ganondorf (Twilight Princess)- Calamity Ganon Battle - Phase 1 (Breath of the Wild)This is the home stage of VVizard's Ganondorf mod, and part of VVizard's Final Frenzy!

From Reimi and her dog Arnold, to Josuke and his gang, to even a couple small surprises, I made sure to cram as many as I could to ensure this town remains busy.Though, due to one of the cameos also being made into a fighter recently, I've also included measures for them if they are in play.There is also a slightly different stage layout for the Aether variant, which also trims a couple cameos that are featured on the 2 platforms in the normal layout to help give a clear indication of the platforms being removed in that particular layout.Left C-Stick - \"[BlastProcessed] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable - Crazy Noisy Bizarre Town\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGlriVeUZ5sRight C-Stick - \"[Hooded Edge] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable - Chase\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F837uckdBswUp C-Stick - \"[BlastProcessed] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable - Great Days\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEFmt4nZgvgDown C-Stick - \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle - Golden Spirit (Theme of Josuke)\"Special - \"Siivagunner: King for Another Day - Killer\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip_91w2hui8Extra credits to BlastProcessed, Hooded Edge, and the Siivagunner team for the use of their covers of iconic Jojo Part 4 music.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":2791,"currentSubscribers":6926,"currentFavorites":167},"id":"3017021536"}

(Heavily simplified) Controls [Attack button] - Confirm/Interact with object in front of your character.[Special button] - Decline/Back (Hold to Run)[Jump button] - Open the menu (when in the field) Battle System Turn based combat taking place on four tiles around the enemy.On their turn, characters can move to adjacent tiles, attack, or use abilities.Every enemy has a unique gimmick. Strategically position your characters to avoid as much damage as possible.Read the in-game manual for more details! Featuring 8000+ word script (i think i got a C in high school english class)A fully original soundtrack with 10 songsA turn based battle system that has never been used before (i wonder why?)Getting pulled into a scripted cutscene every three steps you takeTreasure chests containing untold richesAround 40-60 minutes of gameplay per run? (It heavily depends on how bad you are, or how much stuff you skip. for reference it takes me 20 minutes to speedrun the whole thing)Full screen story illustrations that got compressed because rivals is a pixel game so yeah they just look really crappy nowOh my god why is there so much dialogue I just want to fight stuffTwo different endings I think? Probably. \"Credits\" coding by megame design/concepts by meartworks and sprites by memusic by mesound design by me (made from free/basecast sfx sources)story/characters/writing by me(insert picture of obama giving himself a medal) Also you can get the soundtrack from here https://youtu.be/Fx9GxM3ANnA DISCLAIMER Due to the large scale of this project, you may have performance issues when trying to run it.If you play Rivals on a toaster, try switching to Lite Mode in the Settings (from within the mod's title screen).This will reduce the amount of stuff drawn (mostly text outlines) and can double your FPS in menus.Additionally, you should enter the stage using basecast characters.

Then he respawns after about 15 seconds.I spent way too long animating the characters in the background... they also have gameplay interactions, where they clap when someone gets a KO.This is Yellow's home stage, download him here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3080756517 He has a unique interaction with the background characters when he taunts, and based on the color you use, some of the characters might not appear when he's in the match.

{"title":"Gerudo Desert - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom","description":"A vast desert covered in sandstorms, home of the Gerudo!Gerudo DesertLocated in the southwest of Hyrule lies the vast sandy wastelands of the Gerudo Desert! Home to the mighty Gerudo tribe, few travellers have explored the many sand dunes beyond the road to Gerudo Town. Perhaps it's uncharted for a reason...?While Gerudo Desert and the Gerudo themselves have appeared in many games across The Legend of Zelda series, this version of the desert is based on the most common version found in BotW/AoC/TotK. Basic Mode is based on BotW, featuring an abandoned monster camp and various landmarks like the Great Gerudo Skeleton and Gerudo Town in the distance. Aether Mode is based on TotK, switching out the distant Sheikah tech for Zonai shrines and a Lookout Tower, while also engulfing the desert in a sand shroud! If both players are on their last stock, or the time runs down to one minute, the desert will shake as a sandstorm descends upon the stage! Both modes also feature a cameo from the hero of Hyrule himself, which will be removed if Link is picked to appear in the match. The version of Link that appears will also differ per mode!Gerudo Desert features fourteen different music options from across the series, spinoffs, and Smash! Three different songs also change to a phase 2 if the last stock sandstorm is triggered, marked in the list below with a *.Tired of randomization and want to select the song yourself? Hold shield/parry and a direction on either stick or the keyboard during the match countdown! The available options change per mode and are as follows: (UP: 1/10, RIGHT: 4/11, DOWN: 5/13, LEFT: 7/14)Basic Only: Gerudo Valley (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D Official Soundtrack) The Legend of Zelda Battle Quest - Gerudo Valley (Nintendo Land) Gerudo Valley (Remix) (Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U) The Champion Urbosa (Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity) Divine Beast Vah Naboris Battle (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Original Soundtrack) Divine Beast Vah Naboris Looms (Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity)*Basic & Aether: Molduga Battle (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Original Soundtrack) Intense Battle against the Molduga (Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity)*Aether Only: Gerudo Desert (The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD Original Soundtrack) Sandstream (Hyrule Warriors) Thunderblight Ganon Battle (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Original Soundtrack) Defending Kara Kara Bazaar (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom) Defending Gerudo Town (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom) Queen Gibdo Battle (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom)*Gerudo Town also features Talking Flower compatibility upon triggering the last stock sandstorm!Want to use my Music Display system for yourself?

This is the second level of Freedom Planet 2, taking place as Team Lilac heads for the Royal Palace of Shang Tu to meet with the Magister for an important mission! Shenlin Park is also a remake of my original LEGO version, which can be found here if interested.Basic Mode features a layout similar to Spirit Tree, with two raised platforms hanging over the river. Take a seat on the bench or rest under the tree as you wait for the monorail to go by, or switch over to Aether Mode and sail down the river on a cruise ship! Aether Mode features one platform and flat ground, complete with screen wrapping on the side blastzones for seamless travel!Basic Mode also features cameos from Team Lilac, which will be removed if one of the corresponding characters appear in the match. Aether Mode includes a cameo as well from Shenlin Park's boss, though rumor says it may appear on Basic as well...Shenlin Park features twelve different music options split between two groups! Songs from Freedom Planet 2 play by default but if you press taunt during the match countdown you can trigger the Jukebox, a set of bonus songs from the original Freedom Planet!Tired of randomization and want to select the song yourself? Hold shield/parry and a direction on either stick or the keyboard during the match countdown!

{"title":"Kindlers' Crucible","description":"An ancient temple located within the maw of an active volcanoOnce, an ancient group of nomadic smiths known as the Kindlers took up residence within the mouth of a great volcano on the southern peninsula of Aether. There, they forged powerful weapons and artifacts that helped shape countless battles in this land’s past. However, this group eventually vanished without a trace, only leaving behind the monolithic ruins of their ancient temple forge, with little in the way of iconography to discern a culture from them. Centuries later, a reclusive hermit has taken residence within those blasted ruins to hone his mastery over magma beyond what the Fire Nation sect of Elementalism can provide. He cares not for the civilization who once lived here, only that he may increase his strength to greater heights.A stage companion to Vakna, the Molten Hermit, with a stage layout directly pulled from Spirit Tree. Only the foolish or the unfathomably strong would dare set foot here… so which one are you, traveler?CreditsAnimation and Implementation – ArtistOfSeerStage Theme – Delta Parallax","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":1063,"currentSubscribers":3768,"currentFavorites":66},"id":"3136332445"}

{"title":"El Dorado Clone City","description":"El Dorado Clone City, the final level of Drancia Saga, now appears as a stage in Rivals of Aether! Home to various riches and golden enemies, as well as the final boss of the original game, Drancia and the Emerald Tablet.The Basic Form of this stage features a wide stage length with a single wide platform that periodically moves back and forth across the stage at set time intervals, similar to Julesvale.The Aether form of this stage removes the plat and widens out the stage to be a walk-off. Additionally, giant golden swords will now periodically fall from the sky, crashing into the stage with tremendous force and dealing damage to anyone it hits. Enemies from the original game will also appear and attack the players!Enemy Types and Behaviors:Knight: Spawns on either side of the stage and walks back and forth. If it gets near a player, it will swing both of its swords down and do a spin attack that hits multiple times.Slime: Rises from the bottom of the stage and climbs it until it reaches ground level. Afterwards, it will walk back and forth across the stage.Cannon: Spawns on either side of the stage and will fire bullets up to 3 times before leaving.Demon: Glides down to either the topmost and left or rightmost corners of the screen. From there, it will divebomb the players twice before leaving.Skeleton: Rises from the ground at a random spot on the stage, then runs towards the opposite end of the stage, damaging players in its way.All enemies can be defeated by either hitting them with an attack OR parrying any of their attacks. Additionally, only one of each enemy (except the Slime, that’s an exception) can be onstage at a single time.Music Tracks:Area 8: El Dorado Clone City (Drancia Saga) + The Emerald Tablet (Drancia Saga)(The two tracks are combined into a single track for this stage.)(The character in the screenshots is Harold (not made by me), you can download them here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894353323)I was at one point considering making a character from Drancia Saga as a playable character in Rivals of Aether, but every time I never really ended up going through with it.

These range from official Wii model colors and console variations, Nintendo's previous console (the Gamecube), and even Rivals itself, which are as follows:Basic Mode: - White - Black - Red (Wii Mini) - RivalsAether Mode: - Blue - Pink - Gamecube - MiiverseThere's also a bonus theme that has a rare chance of appearing on either mode, are you lucky enough to get it?Nintendo Wii features sixteen songs from various Wii series games, remixes from Smash and Mario Kart, and even the Wii itself!

Oh hi, I'm Golden Touch, I'm sure you didn't heard about me so far, and this is the perfect time to tell you that me and the fellow friends that participate in the stage are not from the world you think we are, nope! We are from a white space where anything can happen as I know from my analysis, a place were anyone is there to do stuff uncanonically, in other words, a place were anything can happen with no rules at all, I mean, even I'm from a distant future, anyways, this is my greatest creation! I name it... \"Skylight Nightscape\"!A stage that makes a conection between Rivals of Aether and this uncanon space I already explained, it's main purpose is develop some fun between fighters of all kind, competitive and casual players.Basic version is modified to happen nothing in stage making all game focus on the showdown, with 5 platforms that form a pyramid, the higher it is, the easier is defeat opponents, from quite hard to incredibly quick, but if you want reach the top platform, you have to get ready to bring the opponent there in the first place!Aether version shakes up things a little bit, the low and high platforms are codified to change positions in the Y axis every  minute, that comes with a... little disfunction that has the screen, seems it has some issues with the changing positions and makes a shockwave that covers the ground, to solve the issue, I coded into the screen when is going to give a shockwave, and as an adition, the table is a platform in the case, and you don't mind we do some sound from time to time right?As an adition we got a full selection of music that you'll like hear in battle, I listed them all in the image preview sectionAnd lastly, I hope I made the information understandable for you because well... Golden.Language != Viewer.LanguageIs she... finally gone?

The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.\" - CorniferGreenpathMassive shout out to Reiga for asking me to design Greenpath as a home stage for their take on The Knight! Check out the mod here!The second area of Hollow Knight, Greenpath is home to lush flora, humid air, and mossy creatures big and small. The first step of the \"The Pilgrim's Way\", Greenpath is full of natural beauty and dangerous obstacles, should travelers leave the Pale King's roads and dare to enter the land of Unn unprepared. It's also a remake of the LEGO original, which can be found here.Basic Mode features an asymmetrical layout, split between the ornate roads and untamed wilds beyond. Travelers can take comfort in the worn stone bench and soft glow of the lamp post, but don't let down your guard! Aether Mode adds an additional platform on the right, but also features burning acid below! Both modes also feature two different cameos from the Knight and Hornet, which will be removed if one of the corresponding characters appear in the match. Can you spot them both? Greenpath features 6 songs from Hollow Knight's original soundtrack, the dlc updates, and even two unique mixes using the files straight from the game!Tired of randomization and want to select the song yourself? Hold shield/parry and a direction on either stick or the keyboard during the match countdown! The available options are as follows: (UP: 1, RIGHT: 3, DOWN: 4, LEFT: 5) Greenpath (Hollow Knight (Original Soundtrack)) Greenpath (Ambient Mix) (Hollow Knight) Greenpath (Action Mix) (Hollow Knight) Hornet (Hollow Knight (Original Soundtrack)) Daughter of Hallownest (Hollow Knight: Gods & Nightmares) Greenpath (Early Ver.)

Completely made of cheese and home to backwards travelling Moon Cows, The Moon is the perfect getaway for players tired of the rest of The Vote Update's hijinks! Basic Mode features an FD layout with no platforms, due to The Moon's fairly flat terrian, and while Aether Mode doesn't change the layout, it does add a low gravity effect! Perhaps the lower gravity will allow previously impossible combos to be performed? Either way, watch the Earth rise over the horizon as you leap incredible heights to your heart's content!While The Moon doesn't feature any unique music in Minecraft itself, six different songs from the game overall have been chosen to fit the vibe of the stage!Tired of randomization and want to select the song yourself? Hold shield/parry and a direction on either stick or the keyboard during the match countdown!

{"title":"TR_KARMA","description":"Artwork by RusronCode by TinMinesThe map for every TF2 weapon demonstration makes its way into Rivals of Aether as a stage, along with all of its infamous wooden cutouts. On the Aether form of TR_KARMA, these cutouts act as powerups, traps, and everything in-between themed around each individual class. Every effect is reminiscent of their abilities in Team Fortress 2, and they perform the following:Scout: The player who broke the cutout gains a speed boost while walking, running, and moving in neutral air states for 10 seconds.Soldier: The player who broke the cutout now has +2 double-jumps for 10 seconds.Pyro: The player who broke the cutout now ignites enemies on each hit (as long as it puts players into enough hitstun), and attacks now deal 1.5x more damage to players that are burning.Demoman: A large pack of dynamite drops to the ground, and when it detonates it sends several explosives across the stage.Heavy: The player who broke the cutout now has 10 soft armor on each attack for 10 seconds: This means that only attacks dealing more than 10 damage will cause a player to get interrupted out of their attack. Remember, it doesn’t prevent you from taking this damage, it only prevents flinching.Engineer: 5 mini-sentry “rats” surround the broken cutout, then they fly towards the player who destroyed the cutout. They deal a lot of damage, but these sentries can hit any player: smart players can use the auto-targeting to hit opponents.Medic: A miniature Medic descends from the skies and flies towards whoever destroyed the cutout. When it lands on the player, they receive 3 health every 1.5 seconds. The mini Medic will fly away after the player reaches 0 health or when the player is put into enough hitstun. (These mini Medics can stack if you destroy multiple cutouts, but they all will be blown away at once when hit)Sniper: A jar of… jarate is quickly thrown onto the stage and lands with a splash. Any players unfortunate enough to be covered in piss now receive 1.3x damage and knockback for 10 seconds. One redeeming quality is that jarate extinguishes flames, which players can use to shut down the Pyro powerup at the cost of extra knockback.Spy: The player who broke the cutout now has improved evasive maneuvers (rolls and airdodge). Your roll now produces an illusion going the opposite direction to throw off opponents, and your airdodges now go significantly farther and give some invisibility.The music used is all from Open Fortress: A Team Fortress 2 mod that makes the game much more like an arena shooter.At Fortress’ Gate (a Doom remix): https://youtu.be/bJUnEuVP0aM?si=G0AAkKxha7TGjeBoDM_Skate: https://youtu.be/cai39LNSDMo?si=O6QUnr4xXJIjJyQ-Chase: https://youtu.be/_aPhakVj5wY?si=aGrCKLZMuyy4zvEuLess Talk More Fight: https://youtu.be/raePBu673JA?si=Kz-keVAh1IZM6vVuFor those wondering what the Chinese text next to the Wiki Hat and flowers is for, it translates to \"Goodbye\" and is for KarmaCharger, the person who recorded most of the TF2 Wiki Demonstration videos and is who the original TR_KARMA map in TF2 was created for.

{"title":"Jade Creek","description":"A large river on the outskirts of Shang Tu. Set at night the moon overlooks the stage as the fight commences. Stage 5 in the original Freedom Planet.As the conflict between the three kingdoms escalates three teenage girls are jailed for past crimes they have since tried to redeem themselves from under extremely harsh circumstances. However they have broken free from prison and the local policewoman isn't very happy about this. Cut to the nearby river where the chase sequence happens.This stage has two forms, a Basic variant that has a very wide main stage platform which fast characters will love as well as an Aether variant that acts as a recreation of Neera's boss fight arena from Freedom Planet 1. You can even attack the ice walls and break them to create an opening to knock your opponents out of the stage!The basic version of this stage features a few cameos. Some dragon girl and catgirl have escaped prison and a policewoman panda isn't very happy about that and is giving chase. Neera will hunt down Lilac and Carol on her policeboat in the background of the stage while you are fighting, where she will be chasing either Lilac or Carol at random who are sprinting/riding as fast as possible along the waters surface to get away from the angry panda. These cameos will be altered if Lilac, Carol or Neera are actually fighting on the stage. If Neera is fighting the chase event won't play out at all. If Lilac or Carol are fighting then they won't appear in the chase sequence at all, if one of them is fighting the other will be chased by Neera in the background and if both Lilac and Carol are fighting Neera will be seeking them out in the background on her own.The stage features 6 music tracks and uses ATalksToSelf's music template, music tracks are taken from both games. You can pick between all six with the following combinations:Music tracks are as follows:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Jade Creek 1 - Freedom Planet (Shield + Up)2. Jade Creek 2 - Freedom Planet (Shield + Right)3. Naolo Lake - Freedom Planet 2 (Shield + Down)4. Palace Courtyard - Freedom Planet 2 (Shield + Taunt)5. Mini-Boss theme - Freedom Planet (Shield + Left)6.

{"title":"SSL Jade Creek","description":"A large river on the outskirts of Shang Tu. Set at night the moon overlooks the stage as the fight commences. This is SSL Neera's home stage, a river not too far from the Royal Palace. A few former criminals have broken free of her icy prison and are making a break for it. This will NOT stand.Not too fond of SSL? There's a full Rivals version of this stage which you can find here.Comes in monochrome and GBC colour variants. The stage layout is based on Glacial Fortress (yes I know, ice character gets Glacial fortress layout).Music for this stage is a monochrome 8 bit remix of Jade Creek from Freedom Planet 1. This remix was originally created by Zzzzx in 2015, of which a snippet is also SSL Neera's victory theme. Original song composed by Leila \"Woofle\" Wilson.

{"title":"Xen","description":"This stage was made for an event I hosted where myself and several friends designed stages that I built for us to play a tournament on. This was a friend's stage design.The basic form of this stage features low gravity for all characters and a unique hazard in the form of Vortigaunts. Vortigaunts spawn in one of three locations and ally with the first player to touch them or against the first player to hit them, aiding in the fight with a ranged lightning attack and a melee claw swipe. They're entirely vulnerable to damage and suffer hitstun while also acting as platforms. If you wish to play in the low-grav without them, you can simply press special at the start of the match to vote to disable them, as indicated by the custom UI.The Aether form of this stage is based on the chapter Focal Point from Half-Life: Blue Shift and features the titular focal point device as an additional central platform. The Aether form has standard gravity, but features jump pads toward the sides of the stage; these jump pads add a set amount of upward movement to any character leaving the ground while standing on them, not only from jumping but also from moves that leave the ground or even from being hit. Its platforms also have healing pools, which slowly reduce the percent of anyone standing in front of them.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2486633548125415106/EC74EB48D3B91D1BA94E738A6BF7473F6A70DD9C/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":120,"currentSubscribers":179,"currentFavorites":3},"id":"3294399661"}

The neon aesthetic was the result of my own art direction.Map includes a unique hazard in the form of a ball that rolls back and forth across the stage, dealing damage and knockback to anyone who touches it.This stage features original music.","previewImage":null,"stats":{"uniqueVisitors":174,"currentSubscribers":175,"currentFavorites":5},"id":"3294399949"}
{"title":"Hamster Cage","description":"This stage was made for an event I hosted where myself and several friends designed stages that I built for us to play a tournament on. This was a friend's stage design.Hamster Cage features 3 unique hazards. The hamster wheel in the right side of the cage spins when hit and will carry this momentum as it slowly comes to a standstill again. It has an active hitbox while spinning that gets stronger the faster it moves, and the mechanic of pushing airborne players who attack it away, which prevents them from simply being hit by it as soon as they activate it with an attack, makes for fun, albeit janky movement tech. The plastic tubes that span the stage can be entered with a hard up input in any player state, even special fall, and teleport the player directly from one to the other with a short animation. Soft up inputs can be used to perform upward attacks in front of them without teleporting. The cat in the background of the stage moves and tracks players. It will cycle between every player in the match, losing interest and changing target when it's attacked them, they've hidden for long enough behind objects within the cage, or they leave the cage. It attacks with quick swipes between the bars of the stage.The two forms of this stage have the same hazards but different layouts.This stage features original music.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2486633548125311305/D7B44DB2D4668879F6E27F60B257DEDB4CE2745E/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":316,"currentSubscribers":622,"currentFavorites":11},"id":"3294400102"}

This was one of my stages.The titular Ferris wheel is completely functional and slowly rotates with all of its carriages. These carriages, acting as platforms, are the only ground to stand on. Only the top portion of the wheel is out of the blast zone, so players are constantly forced to be on the move.The Aether form of this stage has the wheel break loose and roll through a city at speed. This makes the wheel spin twice as fast, but has no other gameplay effect.This stage features original music, with different tracks for the stage's two forms.","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2486633548125314899/6F317AA5EAC229A95E14EC8C6DE8E7D8E8F57400/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":179,"currentSubscribers":326,"currentFavorites":7},"id":"3294400394"}

Fight them until you can't fight anymore...This stage is a game mode where you play against a horde of enemies in waves. Demons will keep coming at you (or your team), each with their own abilities and challenges, creating deadly combinations!SOUL ESSENCE:Sometimes in Normal mode only, demons will drop Soul Essence, which come in various sizes and colors.There are a total of 4 different effects Soul Essence can grant, depending on the size of the soul: Green: Instantly heal 20% / 40% / 60%. Red: Increases damage output by x1.5 for 30 / 60 / 90 seconds. Blue: Increases horizontal speed by x1.3 while not attacking or in hitstun for 30 / 60 / 90 seconds. Yellow: Decreases damage and knockback taken by x0.75 for 30 / 60 / 90 secondsNOTABLE FEATURES:TRAINING MODE:When going into the stage in practice mode, you can see all the demons you may fight, their tactics and try to fight them in various combination of your choosing.Additionally, you can press the \"Start Test Run\" button to go for a simulated run of the horde, which tells you how many waves you managed to survive.NOTE: YOU MUST USE YOUR MOUSE TO USE THE MENUS IN PRACTICE MODE!SCORE MULTIPLIERS:You can add some score to your final score if you tweak the knockback scaling settings in the character select screen. The score multiplier directly corresponds to the knockback scaling setting you chose, which means if you make yourself harder to kill, the score system will adapt.On top of that, going into aether mode will switch the demon horde into Cruel mode, which spawns less demons make they are a lot more difficult. Here is the full list of changes for the demons on the Cruel mode: x1.5 score multiplier on the final score 6 enemy spawn limit Demons won't drop any Soul Essence buffs x1.5 max hp x0.9 knockback adj x0.75 knockback scaling taken (x1.25 normally) x0.75 idle time and attack time x1.5 damage (including the Necro Magus healing) x1.2 base knockback given x1.05 knockback scaling givenOther than all that, for devs, it's recommended to add the hit_player.gml event from adventure mode and draw_hud.gml event compatibility from Enter the Golden House to your characters so their hud will appear and most hit based mechanics will work.For more information click hereSPECIAL THANKS:Supersonic and DarkDakurai for helping me with optimizations, it was really difficultAnd everyone from the All-Star Heroines team for the whole collection, pushing on and making this possible, it was honestly really awesome to work alongside a team of people to make this collection a reality, as a part of my last big project on Rivals of Aether","previewImage":"https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2403320125984431031/B2EA1534D7F71CC3F071CDE627B7217A2FDDC48D/?imw=268&imh=151&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true","stats":{"uniqueVisitors":6077,"currentSubscribers":7204,"currentFavorites":200},"id":"3316060490"}

Based on La Guardia, the Lookout Tower built right next to Mostroferrato/Salabona.The stage features a moving platform that starts at the middle, then moves back and forth to each side platform. The code for this platform was stolen from the Jambert stage.This is the most effort I've put into making a stage. All of the assets (except for the moving platform code) were drawn by me.
